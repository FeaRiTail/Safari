Thank you for downloading my first Minecraft plugin, I hope you and your players
will enjoy it as much as I did designing it.

Put the Safari.jar File into the plugins/ folder of your Minecraft server directory.
(Pretty eash, huh?)

This plugin was developed on a craftbukkit-server 1.2.5 R4.0.

of his "LessFood" Plugin (http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/lessfood/)
