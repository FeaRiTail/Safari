Howdy :)
Thank you for downloading my first Minecraft plugin, I hope you and your players
will enjoy it as much as I did desiging it.

For installation:
Put the Safari.jar File into the plugins/ folder of your Minecraft server directory.
(Pretty eash, huh?)


This plugin was developed on a craftbukkit-server 1.2.5 R4.0.
