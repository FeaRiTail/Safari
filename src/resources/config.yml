### Safari Configuration File
### 
### GLOBAL SETTINGS
global-settings:
    enabled: true
    allowed-commands: /start, /stop, /list, /info, /stats
    update-notification: true


###
#
# Some permission/config stuff
#
### enabled_worlds: Specifies, on which worlds the Safaris should work
# e.g.: On Non-freebuild servers there usually is a "peaceful" world with no mobs spawning
# and people building their homes. If such people would posess a Mob-spawner in their cellars,
# they could easily cheat on Safaris...
### admin_permission: this setting defines the permission which is necessary to set "safari.enabled_worlds".
# may be used together with a permissions-plugin like PEX?    
# the Plugin uses: if(player.hasPermission(config.get("safari.admin_permission"))) {} to
# filter the command (or if the command comes from the servers console, which is always an indicator for admin ;) )

  enabled_worlds:
    - world1

  admin_permission: some.super.permission

### Safari Configurations
# Below you can configure the safaris which will be available on your server
# in the "types_of_mobs_to_kill" Section you will have to provide the Mobs-Constant Values as defined in:
# http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
# just put one Mob-Type per line, the Mob-Types may be spelled case-insensitive (so e.g.: "SLIME", "Slime" and "slime" are equally recognized)
# for convenience, the Constants are listed at the end of the file

# valid_hours: if null: safari is valid all day and night times
# if valid_hours is set, it needs to be an array of "hours" (24-hour format: e.g. 14 = 2 p.m) into the list
# like: [20,21,22,23,24,0,1,2,3,4] which corresponds to night-hours: 8 p.m. until 4 a.m.

# drop configuration:
# see:http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/lessfood/#w-configuration-file-example-config-yml
